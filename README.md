# About me

It's a kind of grief, isn't it, when you are 40 years old and you realise you would have so much more opportunities ahead of you if you had pursued a stem field, and opportunities you probably would have enjoyed and that would have made you feel more fulfilled. But now you have a family and that is no longer a sane option, so you stay there, in the limbo of what is feasible...

... this is the limbo.


I'm a senior freelance translator, specialised in EU Affairs, Medical/Pharma, Psychology and IT.
I am curious by nature, I thrive on learning new things and understanding how things work. And recently I found a place where this learning is always happening: Technology.
I began learning Python in 2019, then covid pressed pause on any plans for the future for a while.
I resumed a couple of years ago, learned Python (basics to intermediate), SQL (basics), C (the basics of the basics) and Power BI (pressing buttons is also fine).

I want to share here what I have been learning, hoping to be able one of these days to work as a team, in technology, with the opportunity not only to learn more, but also to put this new knowledge into practice.

Fun fact:
