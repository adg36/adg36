# About me

I'm a senior freelance translator, specialised in EU Affairs, Medical/Pharma, Psychology and IT.
I am curious by nature, I thrive on learning new things and understanding how things work. And recently I found a place where this learning is always happening: Technology.
I began learning Python in 2019, then covid pressed pause on any plans for the future for a while.
I resumed a couple of years ago, learned Python (basics to intermediate), SQL (basics), C (the basics of the basics) and Power BI (pressing buttons is also fine).

I want to share here what I have been learning, hoping to be able one of these days to work as part of a team, in technology, with the opportunity not only to learn more, but also to put this new knowledge into practice.
